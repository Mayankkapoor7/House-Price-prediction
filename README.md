# House-Price-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices in the USA using linear regression. Various regularization techniques, gradient descent optimization, and k-fold cross-validation have been applied to enhance model performance and generalization.

The goal of this project is to predict the price of houses based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc. We employ a variety of techniques to ensure that the model is not only accurate but also generalizes well to unseen data.

Key components include:

Linear Regression: Basic regression model for price prediction.
Regularization Techniques: Ridge (L2), Lasso (L1), and Elastic Net.
Gradient Descent: For optimization of model parameters.
K-Fold Cross Validation: To validate model performance and prevent overfitting.
